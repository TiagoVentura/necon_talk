### iLCSS: Social Science meets Data

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[iLCSS]


**Truth be Told**  is one of the many projects I have been working as a member of the [Interdisciplinary Lab for Computational Social Science](https://ilcss.umd.edu/) at UMD

Before we start, I want to say a few words about how this project fits in our broader mission at iLCSS. 

At iLCSS we replicate a logic quite strong on hard-science labs: most of our work is collaborative and involves several co-authors. So I want to thanks my co-authors on this paper:

- Natalia Aruguete (UnQ), Ernesto Calvo (UMD), Ingrid Bachman (Puc-Chile), Sebastian Valenzuela (Puc-Chile)

- And *Chequeado*

## Truth be told: Cognitive moderators of selective sharing of fact-checks on social media


---
## A Glimpse of the Literature

--

Previous work have discussed several reasons why people share misinformation:

- Partisan-Sharing and Negative Partisanship (Guess, Nagler, & Tucker 2019; Osmundsen et. al. 2021)

- Lack of Cognitive Sophistication (Pennycock and Rand 2019)

- Digital Literacy (Guess, Nagler & Tucker 2019)

- Polarization, Highly Partisan Media Outlets (Faris et al 2017; Eldridge 2017)


---

### Fact-Checking 

Fact-checkers have become ubiquitous to most media companies. Several recent scholarly work on the effects of fact-checking correction:

- Fact-checking overall reduces misperceptions (Walter et al 2020, Wood and Porter, 2021, Nyhan et. al. 2020).

- Little Evidence of back-fire effect (Wood and Porter, 2019).

---
class: middle

While we have enough evidence for the effects of corrections on attitudes, less is known considering the effects of corrections on behavior on-line. Particularly, investigations on cognitive moderators of sharing corrections.

- Users prefer to share pro-attitudinal corrections (Ekstrom & Lai, 2020, Lewendosky et al., 2012)

- Partisans consult congenial sources to adjudicate between true/false (Peterson and Iyengar, 2020)

## Research Design

### Research Design: Experiment + Social Media Data

<br><br>

Our paper combines two distinct empirical approaches:

- .red[On-line Experiment] ~> Two Stage, Two Arm Experiment, where respondents are assigned to True/False Fact-Checking Corrections. 

- .red[Observational data] ~> Social media from Twitter + a regression discontinuity design.

### Observational Social Media Data

---

### Modeling the activation of Fact-Checkers

<br><br>
Our experiment provided evidence of selective sharing of .red[‘true’] and .red[‘false’] fact-checks.

To assess the robustness of experimental findings, we introduce supporting evidence of **partisan selective sharing** as stated in H1 using real-world social media data.

We focus on the **false rumor** that Macri was using a ear device (*audifono*) during the debate

---
### Research Design

<br><br>

Using the Twitter APIs we collected close to .red[3 million] Tweets during the two weeks around the debate.

- Filtered only **retweets** 

- Searched for the *audifono* misinformation (simple regex search)

- Employed **Community Detection algorithms** to identify Pro-Macri and Anti-Macri

Using the exact time of the Chequeado Correction (False), we estimated the causal effects (.red[Regression Discontinuity Design]) of the intervention on users' reaction (time-to-retweet)



---

### Results: Time-to-Retweet after the Correction

### Conclusion

<br><br><br>

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[Research Findings]


- Users exhibit .red[partisan reasoning] when sharing corrections. 

- More important,  a pro-attitudinal fact-check labeled .red[true] is more likely to be shared on social media than an equally congenial fact-check labeled .red[false]

- This result suggests that sharing fact-checking messages is regulated by the .red[hot cognition] and confirmatory bias (directional goals driven by automatic responses)
